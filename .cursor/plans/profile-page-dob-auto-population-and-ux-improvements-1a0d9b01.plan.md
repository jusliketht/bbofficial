# Phase 3: Profile Settings Improvements

## Overview

Implement critical improvements for Profile Settings page based on audit findings. Focus on replacing mock data with real API integrations and adding missing validations.

---

## Part 1: Bank Accounts Tab Integration

### 1.1 Create Bank Accounts API Endpoints

**Current State:**

- Bank Accounts tab uses hardcoded mock data
- No API endpoints exist for managing user bank accounts

**Implementation:**

- Create backend endpoints for bank account management:
  - `GET /api/users/bank-accounts` - Get user's bank accounts
  - `POST /api/users/bank-accounts` - Add new bank account
  - `PUT /api/users/bank-accounts/:id` - Update bank account
  - `DELETE /api/users/bank-accounts/:id` - Delete bank account
  - `PATCH /api/users/bank-accounts/:id/set-primary` - Set primary account

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- `backend/src/routes/user.js` - Add bank accounts routes
- `backend/src/controllers/UserController.js` - Add bank account methods

**Expected Endpoint Structure:**

```javascript
// GET /api/users/bank-accounts
{
  success: true,
  data: [
    {
      id: 1,
      bankName: 'HDFC Bank',
      accountNumber: '****1234', // Masked
      fullAccountNumber: '12345678901234', // Only for display when needed
      ifsc: 'HDFC0001234',
      accountHolderName: 'John Doe',
      accountType: 'savings', // savings, current
      isPrimary: true,
      createdAt: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
      updatedAt: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'
    }
  ]
}
```

### 1.2 Create Bank Account Service (Frontend)

**Implementation:**

- Create `frontend/src/services/api/bankAccountService.js`
- Implement methods: `getBankAccounts()`, `addBankAccount()`, `updateBankAccount()`, `deleteBankAccount()`, `setPrimaryAccount()`
- Use existing `apiClient` pattern

**Files to Create:**

- `frontend/src/services/api/bankAccountService.js`

### 1.3 Integrate Bank Accounts API in BankAccountsTab

**Current State:**

- Uses hardcoded mock data in `useState`
- "Add Bank Account" button doesn't work

**Implementation:**

- Replace mock data with React Query hook
- Add loading and error states
- Implement "Add Bank Account" form/modal
- Add edit and delete functionality
- Add set primary account functionality
- Use skeleton loader during loading

**Files to Modify:**

- `frontend/src/pages/User/ProfileSettings.js` - Update BankAccountsTab component

**Key Changes:**

```javascript
// Replace mock data with API call
const { data: bankAccounts, isLoading, error, refetch } = useQuery(
  'bankAccounts',
  () => bankAccountService.getBankAccounts(),
  { refetchOnWindowFocus: false }
);

// Add bank account form/modal
const [showAddForm, setShowAddForm] = useState(false);
```

---

## Part 2: Filings Tab Integration

### 2.1 Integrate Filings API in FilingsTab

**Current State:**

- Uses hardcoded mock data
- API endpoint exists (`itrService.getUserITRs()`)

**Implementation:**

- Replace mock data with `itrService.getUserITRs()` call
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Add loading and error states
- Format filing data properly (assessment year, status, refund amount)
- Add navigation to filing details
- Use skeleton loader during loading

**Files to Modify:**

- `frontend/src/pages/User/ProfileSettings.js` - Update FilingsTab component

**Key Changes:**

```javascript
// Replace mock data with API call
const { data: filingsData, isLoading, error } = useQuery(
  'userFilings',
  () => itrService.getUserITRs(),
  { refetchOnWindowFocus: false }
);

// Transform API data to match display format
const filings = filingsData?.data?.filings?.map(filing => ({
  id: filing.id,
  year: filing.assessmentYear,
  status: filing.status,
  refund: filing.refundAmount || 0,
  date: filing.filingDate || filing.createdAt,
  itrType: filing.itrType,
}));
```

---

## Part 3: Phone Format Validation

### 3.1 Add Frontend Phone Validation

**Current State:**

- Phone input exists but no format validation on frontend
- Backend validates phone format

**Implementation:**

- Add phone format validation in ProfileTab
- Validate on blur and before submit
- Show inline error message for invalid format
- Use same validation as signup: 10 digits, starts with 6-9
- Normalize phone input (remove non-digits)

**Files to Modify:**

- `frontend/src/pages/User/ProfileSettings.js` - Update ProfileTab component

**Validation Function:**

```javascript
const validatePhone = (phone) => {
  if (!phone) return { isValid: true }; // Optional field
  const phoneDigits = phone.replace(/\D/g, '');
  if (phoneDigits.length !== 10) {
    return { isValid: false, error: 'Phone number must be 10 digits' };
  }
  if (!/^[6-9]/.test(phoneDigits)) {
    return { isValid: false, error: 'Phone number must start with 6, 7, 8, or 9' };
  }
  return { isValid: true };
};
```

---

## Part 4: Address Fields (Optional Enhancement)

### 4.1 Add Address Fields to Profile Tab

**Current State:**

- No address fields in profile

**Implementation:**

- Add address, city, state, pincode fields to ProfileTab
- Update formData state
- Update API call to include address fields
- Add validation for pincode (6 digits)

**Files to Modify:**

- `frontend/src/pages/User/ProfileSettings.js` - Update ProfileTab component
- `backend/src/controllers/UserController.js` - Update profile update to handle address fields

**Note:** This is optional and can be deferred if not critical.

## Implementation Priority

### Critical (P0) - Must Fix

1. Bank Accounts API integration
2. Filings API integration
3. Phone format validation

### High Priority (P1) - Fix Soon

1. Bank account add/edit/delete functionality
2. Error handling for API failures
3. Loading states and skeleton loaders

### Medium Priority (P2) - Nice to Have

1. Address fields
2. Set primary bank account functionality
3. Bank account form validation

---

- [ ] Add bank account form works
- [ ] Edit bank account works
- [ ] Delete bank account works
- [ ] Set primary account works

- [ ] Filing navigation works
- [ ] Phone validation works on frontend
- [ ] Phone validation error messages display correctly
- [ ] Loading states show skeleton loaders

- Filings tab shows real data from API
- Phone format validated on frontend before submission
- All API calls handle errors gracefully
- Loading states provide good UX
- Empty states guide users to add data
